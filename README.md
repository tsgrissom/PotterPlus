# PotterPlus

> The goal of PotterPlus is to create a configuration for [NathanWolf's Magic plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/) which faithfully recreates the world of Harry Potter in Minecraft.

Last tested Minecraft server version: **Spigot 1.16.5**

Last tested Magic plugin version: [**Magic 8.2**](http://jenkins.elmakers.com/view/Plugins/job/MagicPlugin/)

*PotterPlus makes no assurance of backwards-compatibility with previous versions of Minecraft or the Magic plugin. We will always test with the latest versions of both pieces of software.*

### What's inside PotterPlus?

ðŸ”® Over 125 custom spells, each of which gets more powerful as you cast it

ðŸ”® 15+ custom mobs, each with their own abilities

ðŸ”® Tons of magical items, potions, brooms, etc. to truly immerse the player

ðŸ”® **And much more**
