# Credits

PotterPlus would not be possible without the work of a few key contributors and a variety of sources for art assets.

It would not be possible without the amazing [Magic plugin](http://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin).

## Contributors

* NathanWolf - Creator and lead developer of the Magic plugin. Has consulted, supported, contributed to, and quickly patched up bugs for hours on end getting PotterPlus, and Magic as a whole to that next level.

## Art Credits

[Data pack](https://github.com/tsgrissom/PotterPlus/wiki/Data-Pack)

The PotterPlus data pack has become a much larger package of symbols, sounds, models and more as the needs of the project grew. As a result, sounds, textures, and more may come from an outside source. PotterPlus has always been an open-source and free project and recognizes its responsibility to respectfully use art assets that have been sourced from other artists.

* The main look of the pack is that of [John Smith Legacy](https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk/) with spell icon textures, both original and from the original Magic and potter example resource packs.
* Sound effects sourced from [freesfx.co.uk](https://freesfx.co.uk/) and [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/) and the original Magic resource pack.

## Techy Stuff

[Atom](https://atom.io/) has been crucial in PotterPlus' quick development. Here's some useful packages I've found in my time using Atom:

* color-picker
* color-tabs
* duplicate-line-or-selection
* file-icons
* intentions
* linter
* linter-ui-default
* markdown-writer
* minimap
* pigments
* project-sidebar

[yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) has been an invaluable tool to make sure the innumerable amount of YAML files in this project stay concise and well-maintained. 

[MagicScan](https://github.com/tsgrissom/MagicScan) is a shameless plug but my tool plugin MagicScan has been very, very useful in making sure that PotterPlus is the best it can be through its analysis of the Magic environment
