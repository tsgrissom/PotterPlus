There is an assortment of shops provided by PotterPlus by default. Shops in Magic are really just spells and can be attached to NPCs, ran by command blocks, etc.

### List of Shops

> TIP: You can demo these spells by performing `/cast <spell-key>`

* `shop_spells`
* [`shop_spells_required`](https://github.com/tsgrissom/PotterPlus/wiki/Required-Spells)
* `shop_ollivander`
* `shop_textbooks`
* `shop_brooms`
* `shop_potions`
* `shop_potions_legendary`
* `shop_potions_ingredients`
* `shop_potions_potions`

For currency the Book Shop, Broom Shop, Potion Shop, and Legendary Potion Shop all use Galleons. To give players galleons, do `/mgive <player> galleon [amount]`.

#### Potion Shop

[Potions info](https://github.com/PotterPlus/PotterPlus/wiki/Potions)

The `shop_potions` is now a menu that has two options, ingredients (`shop_potions_ingredients`) or potions (`shop_potions_potions`) which cast spells bringing up the respective shop. There is a Legendary Potion Shop (`shop_potions_legendary`) which sells more powerful potions.
