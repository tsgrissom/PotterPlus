# Spells

Magic wiki page: [Custom Spells](https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Custom-Spells)

Spells are a very flexible feature provided by Magic which PotterPlus uses in several ways. Some things to note:

1. All spells in PotterPlus inherit from the [Potter example](https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/Potter).
2. That said, most spells in PotterPlus have been completely overhauled or heavily tuned to fit the new configuration.
3. All spells are housed in the [spells folder](https://github.com/tsgrissom/PotterPlus/tree/master/spells).

## How PotterPlus uses spells

* To create graphical menus like progress menus, spell shops, item shops, appearance selectors, etc.
* To power magical items. All magical items are "wands" with spells that enable those items to do cool things.
* For Magic mob abilities. All Magic mobs use spells for their abilities mapped to triggers.
* To power potions. All PotterPlus magic potions, drinkable, throwable or otherwise use spells to handle their effects.
* For actual spells. These are the spells you learn throughout your journey and will cast with your traditional wand.

These are all sorted in folders under the spells folder.
