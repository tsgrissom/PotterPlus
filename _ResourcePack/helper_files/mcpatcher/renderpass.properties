# (Optional) Blending method for render pass 3.  This will be applied to all
# blocks using that rendering pass.
# alpha:   Normal alpha-based blending.  This is the default.
# overlay: Overlay blending based on color.  RGB values > 0.5 brighten the
#          color behind it, < 0.5 darkens, and 0.5 is neutral.
blend.3=alpha

# (Optional) Whether to enable lighting on textures drawn during render pass 3.
# Particularly for overlay blending, this may not be desirable.  The default is
# true for alpha blending and false for overlay blending.
