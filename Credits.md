# Credits

It goes without saying that PotterPlus would not be possible without the incredible work NathanWolf does on the amazing [Magic plugin](http://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin). Further, PotterPlus' level of polish would suffer without the work of contributors, user-submitted issues, software tools, and of course the miscellaneous sources of royalty-free creative assets.

## Contributors

* NathanWolf - Creator and lead developer of the Magic plugin, Nathan has expertly crafted a wonderful tool that has greatly benefited this project. Further, he has also directly been an invaluable asset to the PotterPlus project as he consulted, supported, and even contributed to its development. He has poured a lot of hard work into his Magic as well as the community it fostered, and I would be remiss not to recognize his tremendous hard work and contributions.

## Creative Assets

[Resource Pack](https://github.com/tsgrissom/PotterPlus/tree/master/_ResourcePack)

As the project has grown, so too have its needs for creative assets. Over time, the PotterPlus Resource Pack has expanded into a substantial collection of textures, sounds, models, symbols, and more, many of which have been sourced from outside the project. As a free and open-source project, PotterPlus recognizes its responsibility to use artistic assets in a manner that complies with and respects the intellectual rights of their creators.

### Textures

* The base textures of the pack are those of the [John Smith Legacy](https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk/) resource pack
* Further, the spell icons are derived from original assets as well as those obtained from the Magic plugin's resource packs (default + potter)

### Sound

* Sound effects have been sourced from a combination of Magic plugin resource packs, as well as some royalty-free digital sources:
  * [freesfx.co.uk](https://freesfx.co.uk/)
  * [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

## Software Tools

### Text Editors and IDEs

* The bulk of the work on PotterPlus was done using Atom (RIP!)
* Nowadays, project maintenance is done using both Visual Studio Code and Neovim
* Java code was written using IntelliJ, such as in the case of MagicScan's development as well as when contributing code to the Magic plugin itself

### Linting & Analysis Tools

* [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) has been a very useful tool to ensure the innumerable lines of YAML configuration in this project stay concise and well-maintained.

* [MagicScan](https://github.com/tsgrissom/MagicScan-Plugin), while a shameless self-plug, has proven a very useful tool for refining Magic configurations and avoiding common pitfalls when writing hundreds of lines of YAML.
