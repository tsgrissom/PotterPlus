# Welcome

> The goal of PotterPlus is to faithfully recreate the magical wizarding world of the Harry Potter universe for your Minecraft multiplayer server. To achieve this, we greatly expanded on the base `potter` configuration bundled with [NathanWolf's Magic plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/).

## Version compatibility

* Latest test date: **MM/DD/YYYY**
* Latest tested Spigot server version: **Spigot 1.16.5**
* Latest tested Magic plugin version: [**Magic 8.2**](http://jenkins.elmakers.com/view/Plugins/job/MagicPlugin/)

<small><em>
When conducting testing, we will always use the latest versions of both pieces of software. PotterPlus makes no assurance of backwards-compatibility between it and previous versions of Minecraft, Spigot, or the Magic Plugin, nor Spigot-derived server software such as PaperMC.<br>
Compatibility of PotterPlus configs with alternative server software such as Sponge cannot be guaranteed, even if Magic were to support those alternatives in the future.
