# This file outlines the messages tied to each spell that is castable with a
# traditional wand. Names, descriptions, upgrade descriptions, cast messages,
# etc. are configured here.

# A bit about upgrade descriptions. I try to keep the language consistent
# throughout them so that it's clear what is being gained from leveling the
# spell.
#
# Moving forward I'm working towards displaying values for what is being
# enhanced with each spell level for transparency. These values usually fit
# into one of the formats below.
#
# Timings: &3({X}s->{Y}s) - Durations, cooldowns, etc.
# Flat number: &3({X}->{Y}) - Damage values, etc.
# Distance: &3({X}m->{Y}m) - Ranges, radiuses, etc.
# Percentages: &3({X}%->{Y}%) - Fizzle chances, backfire chances, weights, etc.
# Potion effects: &5({EFFECT} {LEVEL}->{EFFECT} {LEVEL}) - Potion effects.
