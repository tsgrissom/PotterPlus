Potions in PotterPlus have two types, throwable and consumable. Throwable potions generally apply debuffs or unwanted effects in an area of effect whereas consumable potions are consumed by the holder to apply buffs or other cool effects.

## Obtaining potions

There are currently three ways to obtain potions:

1. Go to a [Potion Shop](https://github.com/PotterPlus/PotterPlus/wiki/Shops) NPC and select the Buy Potions option. Spend Galleons to obtain potions.
2. Craft the potion yourself. Not all potions will be craftable and the majority are not set up for crafting yet.
3. Give yourself a potion with `/mgive <name> <potion>`
