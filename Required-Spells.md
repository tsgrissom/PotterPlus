At the end of each path there's a required spell that cannot be unlocked in the regular spell shop. The player needs to obtain this spell after purchasing all of the spells for their year with Academic Credits. There's a sort of drop in setup available in the form of Completion Credits and Required Spell Books. 

At the end of each year, in whatever form that takes for your players (like the end of a questline) give them one Completion Credit (`cc`). The player can take this Completion Credit to a Required Spell Teacher NPC (`shop_spells_required`) to purchase one of the master spell books. Once they have learned this master spell from this book, they can return to their spell teacher and graduate to the next year. This sort of setup allows you to control when the player is deemed ready to graduate to the next year.

## Completion Credits

Completion Credits are the currency used to obtain required spell books and learn the required spells. To give Completion Credits, do `/mgive <player> cc <amount>`. These credits can be spent at a Required Spell Teacher NPC.
