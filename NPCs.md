There's several NPC oriented spells for shops, spells, etc. You can alternatively bring up these menus with `/castp <player> <spell>`. Traditionally, you can rig these spells to run when an NPC is interacted with, and there's a couple ways to do this...

Available NPC spells:
* `spellshop`
* `finalspellshop`
* `progressmenu`
* `upgrades`
* `appearances`
* `wandshop`
* `bookshop`
* `broomshop`
* `potionshop`
* `potionshop_ingredients`
* `potionshop_potions`

## Using Magic NPCs (Recommended)

[Magic NPCs info](https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/wiki/NPC)

Later Magic releases include bundled NPC tools so you don't need to use Citizens and can cut down on server bloat if you don't need all the Citizens features.

1. Do `/mnpc add <name>` to create an NPC at your current location.
2. Do `/mnpc cast <spell>` to set the NPC's spell.
